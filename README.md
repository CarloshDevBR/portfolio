*<h1 align="center">Personal portfolio</h1>*

<p align="center">In this project, as the title suggests, is my personal portfolio,
and the purpose of the portfolio is to introduce myself to the community and recruiters so that in the end I have more visibility
and also to get to know me better. In it I inform about my abilities and some other more personal matters to reach this objective that
I have in this project. The Animate.css library was used by cdn, which creates page scrolling effects. Also used was the library Vanilla.tilt,
in this case it was downloaded, this library creates card effects that were used to display cards of my abilities. I left the links below
